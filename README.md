Reflection on Design, Development, and Application of Computational Graphics

I approach software design by first understanding the problem requirements and breaking the system into smaller, manageable components. For this project, I identified core elements such as object layout, movement, collision behavior, and rendering, and designed each part to work together cohesively. This project strengthened my ability to design modular systems and balance visual goals with technical constraints.

I followed an iterative design process, starting with a simple functional scene and gradually adding complexity through improved layouts, physics-based movement, and state changes. This approach allowed me to test each feature before moving forward and reduced debugging issues. The same incremental and modular design tactics can be applied to future projects to improve maintainability and scalability.

From a development perspective, I focused on building a working baseline first and refining behavior through iteration. I replaced randomized motion with velocity-based physics and implemented state-driven interactions, such as bricks requiring multiple hits before disappearing. Through the milestones, my development process became more structured and intentional.

Computational graphics expanded my understanding of how math, physics, and programming combine to create interactive systems. These skills are valuable both academically and professionally, particularly in fields such as software engineering, game development, simulation, and data visualization.
